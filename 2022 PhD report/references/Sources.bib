	abstract = {Mass-radius relationships for water-rich rocky planets are usually calculated assuming most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1 times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use a 1-D radiative-convective inverse version of the {LMD} generic numerical climate model to derive new theoretical mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. As a result of the runaway greenhouse radius inﬂation effect introduced in previous work, these new mass-radius relationships signiﬁcantly differ from those traditionally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -possibly by several orders of magnitude- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to {TRAPPIST}-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08\%, respectively, assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that signiﬁcant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as {TRAPPIST}-1. Broadly speaking, our results demonstrate that {nonH}2/He-dominated atmospheres can have a ﬁrst-order effect on the mass-radius relationships, even for rocky planets receiving moderate irradiation. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness as a function of planet core gravity and radius, water content, and irradiation. This formula can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet (i.e., with any kind of interior composition ranging from pure iron to pure silicate) more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.},

	abstract = {Planets similar to Earth but slightly more irradiated are expected to enter into a runaway greenhouse state, where all surface water rapidly evaporates, forming an optically thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. For Earth, this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for an increase of only ∼6\% in solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would occur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-sized, temperate planets. Using 1D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for thick, hot water vapor-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit atmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and ﬁnd that it could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of percent of the Earth’s radius). This abrupt radius inﬂation resulting from the runaway-greenhouse-induced transition could be detected statistically by ongoing and upcoming space missions. These include satellites such as {TESS}, {CHEOPS}, and {PLATO} combined with precise radial velocity mass measurements using ground-based spectrographs such as {ESPRESSO}, {CARMENES}, or {SPIRou}. This radius inﬂation could also be detected in multiplanetary systems such as {TRAPPIST}-1 once masses and radii are known with good enough precision. This result provides the community with an observational test of two points. The ﬁrst point is the concept of runaway greenhouse, which deﬁnes the inner edge of the traditional habitable zone, and the exact limit of the runaway greenhouse transition. In particular, this could provide an empirical measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs transition from a temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the runaway greenhouse. Second, it could be used as a test for the presence (and statistical abundance) of water in temperate, Earth-sized exoplanets.},

Smaller planets are sufﬁciently dense to be rocky, but those with radii larger than ∼1.6 {RÅ} are thought to display in many cases hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes up to ∼30\% of the planetary mass. These low-mass planets are highly irradiated and the question of their origin, evolution, and possible links remains open. Here we show that close-in ocean planets affected by the greenhouse effect display hydrospheres in supercritical state, which generate inﬂated atmospheres without invoking the presence of large hydrogen/helium gaseous envelopes. We present a new set of mass–radius relationships for ocean planets with different compositions and different equilibrium temperatures, which are found to be well adapted to low-density sub-Neptune planets. Our model suggests that super-Earths and water-rich sub-Neptunes could belong to the same family of planets, i.e., hydrogen/ helium-free planets, with differences between their interiors simply resulting from the variation in the water content.},

	abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock, and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02–10 {AU} are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the ﬁrst to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02–10 {AU} ) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 {AU} contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 {AU}. We conﬁrm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet’s intrinsic ﬂux drops to a small fraction of the incident ﬂux. For hydrogenhelium planets, we consider cores up to 90\% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ‘‘hot Neptunes’’ have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of \$0.30–0.45 {RJ} are expected. Water planets are \$40\%–50\% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we ﬁt our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including {COROT} and Kepler.},

	abstract = {{GJ} 1214b stands out among the detected low-mass exoplanets, because it is, so far, the only one amenable to transmission spectroscopy. Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to ﬁt the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we ﬁnd that the bulk amount of H/He of {GJ} 1214b is at most 7\% by mass. In general, we ﬁnd the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c, and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10\% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10\%–18\% and 5\%–15\% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We ﬁnd that although a 100\% water composition ﬁts the data for {GJ} 1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. The same is true for Kepler-11f. A robust determination by transmission spectroscopy of the composition of the upper atmosphere of {GJ} 1214b will help determine the extent of compositional segregation between the atmosphere and the envelope.},

We compared different parametrizations for the cloud particle size, by ﬁxing either particle radii or the mixing efﬁciency (parameter fsed), or by estimating particle radii from simple microphysics. The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears to be the best parametrization by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra of brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the L–T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the visible/near-{IR} photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for low-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity. In addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical equilibrium, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature. This effect should signiﬁcantly contribute to the strong variation of methane abundance at the L–T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young exoplanets. Finally, we predict the existence of a continuum of brown dwarfs and exoplanets for absolute J magnitude=15–18 and J - K color=0–3, due to the evolution of the L–T transition with gravity. This self-consistent model therefore provides a general framework to understand the effects of clouds and appears well-suited for atmospheric retrievals.},

Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving planet, this approach is valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To explore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets we have employed model planets created by one implementation of the core accretion mechanism as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. We find that young jovian planets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than predicted by earlier models. Furthermore the time interval during which the young jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter mass planets (1 M\_J) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little at 20 million years, but 10 M\_J planets can take up to 1 billion years to match commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core accretion mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the accretion shock, are correct, then young jovian planets are substantially fainter at young ages than currently believed. These results have important consequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young jovian planets based on observed luminosities.},

These models expand the diversity of model atmospheres currently available, notably to cooler eﬀective temperatures and greater ranges in C/O. Notable improvements from past such models include updated opacities and atmospheric chemistry.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09454},
	abstract = {As Juno is presently measuring Jupiter's gravitational moments to unprecedented accuracy, models for the interior structure of the planet are putted to the test. While equations of state based on first principles or ab initio simulations have been available and used for the two most abundant elements constituting the envelope, hydrogen and helium, significant discrepancies remain regarding the predictions of the inner structure of Jupiter. The differences are severe enough to clutter the analysis of Juno's data and even cast doubts on the usefulness of these computationally expensive {EOSs} for the modeling of the interior of Jupiter and exoplanets at large. Using our newly developed equations of state for hydrogen and helium, we asses the ab initio equations of state currently available and establish their efficiency at predicting the interior structure of Jupiter in a two-layers model. By adjusting our free energy parameterization to reproduce previous ab initio {EOS} behavior, we identify the source of the disagreement previously reported for the interior structure of Jupiter. We further point to area where care should be taken when building {EOS} for the modeling of giant planets. This concerns the interpolation between the ab initio results and the physical models used to cover the low density range as well as the interpolation of the \{{\textbackslash}sl ab initio\} simulation results at high densities. This sensitivity falls well within the uncertainties of the ab initio simulations. This suggests that hydrogen {EOS} should be carefully benchmarked using a simple planetary model before being used in the more advanced planetary models needed to interpret the Juno data. We finally provide an updated version of our ab initio hydrogen {EOS} recently published.},

Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by \${\textbackslash}sim1-2{\textbackslash}\%\$ at the stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model {ATMO}, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams, highlighting how the \$3.5-5.5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ flux window can be used to calibrate vertical mixing in cool T-Y spectral type objects.},

We include relevant equations of state for H, He, as well as C and O elements to cover the temperature-density regime of ultracool dwarf interiors. For various metallicities, we couple the interior models to two sets of model atmospheres as surface boundary conditions.

The typical systematic error associated with uncertainties in input physics in evolutionary models is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.0005 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.

The composition implies a mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a method for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and mass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably well established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in the equation of state, such as may arise when extrapolating from low pressure data, can have significant effects on predicted mass- radius relations, and on planetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed masses and radii of planets and exoplanets. Kepler-10b is apparently 'Earth- like,' likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of the mass of the planet. {CoRoT}-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. {GJ} 1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and {CH}4, suggesting an 'icy' composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of H2O. {CoRoT}-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed atmospheric opacity. {HAT}-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation for hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of higher atomic number. {CoRoT}-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation. The pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1.5+1.2-1.0 {TPa}. The central pressure in {CoRoT}-7b is probably close to 0.8TPa, though may be up to 2TPa.},

              The discovery of numerous exoplanet systems containing diverse populations of planets orbiting very close to their host stars challenges the planet formation theories based on the solar system. Here, we focus on the planets with radii of 2–4 R
              ⊕
              , whose compositions are debated. They are thought to be either gas dwarfs consisting of rocky cores embedded in H
              2
              -rich gas envelopes or water worlds containing significant amounts of H
              2
              O-dominated fluid/ice in addition to rock and gas. We argue that these planets are water worlds.
            
          , 
            
              The radii and orbital periods of 4,000+ confirmed/candidate exoplanets have been precisely measured by the
              Kepler
              mission. The radii show a bimodal distribution, with two peaks corresponding to smaller planets (likely rocky) and larger intermediate-size planets, respectively. While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R
              ⊕
              ) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H
              2
              –He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H
              2
              O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds). Planets in the mass range of 10–15 M
              ⊕
              , if half-ice and half-rock by mass, have radii of 2.5 R
              ⊕
              , which exactly match the second peak of the exoplanet radius bimodal distribution. Any planet in the 2- to 4-R
              ⊕
              range requires a gas envelope of at most a few mass percentage points, regardless of the core composition. To resolve the ambiguity of internal compositions, we use a growth model and conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that many intermediate-size planets are “water worlds.”},

	abstract = {Studying exoplanets with their parent stars is crucial to understand their population, formation and history. We review some of the key questions regarding their evolution with particular emphasis on giant gaseous exoplanets orbiting close to solar-type stars. For masses above that of Saturn, transiting exoplanets have large radii indicative of the presence of a massive hydrogen-helium envelope. Theoretical models show that this envelope progressively cools and contracts with a rate of energy loss inversely proportional to the planetary age. The combined measurement of planetary mass, radius and a constraint on the (stellar) age enables a global determination of the amount of heavy elements present in the planet interior. The comparison with stellar metallicity shows a correlation between the two, indicating that accretion played a crucial role in the formation of planets. The dynamical evolution of exoplanets also depends on the properties of the central star. We show that the lack of massive giant planets and brown dwarfs in close orbit around G-dwarfs and their presence around F-dwarfs are probably tied to the different properties of dissipation in the stellar interiors. Both the evolution and the composition of stars and planets are intimately linked.},

            The atmospheres of sub-Neptunes are expected to exhibit considerable chemical diversity, beyond what is anticipated for gas-giant exoplanets. In the current study, we construct self-consistent radiative transfer and equilibrium chemistry models to explore this chemical diversity. We use {GJ} 436 b as a case study to further study joint atmosphere-interior models. In particular, we constrain the properties of the interior and atmosphere of the planet based on the available Spitzer measurements. While it is possible to fit the emission spectrum of {GJ} 436 b using a high-metallicity model, we demonstrate that such an atmosphere is inconsistent with physically plausible interior structures. It remains the case that no existing study can adequately fit the 4.5-\${\textbackslash}mu\$m Spitzer secondary eclipse measurement, which is probably caused by chemical disequilibrium. Finally, an information content analysis reveals that emission and transmission spectra constrain the carbon-to-oxygen ratio and metallicity at different wavelengths, but the former are less susceptible to flat spectra stemming from highly metal-enriched atmospheres. With the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope, we recommend that future analysis of emission and transmission spectra of sub-Neptune planets are carried out self-consistently using both the atmospheric and interior structure models.},

The {EOS} for the H/He mixture is based on the so-called additive volume law and thus does not take into account the interactions between the two species. A major improvement of the present calculations over existing ones is that we calculate the entropy over the entire density–temperature domain, a necessary quantity for calculations of stellar or planetary evolution. The {EOS} results are compared with existing experimental data, namely Hugoniot shock experiments for pure H and He, and with ﬁrst-principles numerical simulations for both the single elements and the mixture.

	abstract = {Given the forthcoming launch of the James Webb Space Telescope ({JWST}), which will allow observing exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, spectral coverage, and spatial resolution, the uncertainties in the atmosphere modeling used to interpret the data need to be assessed. As the ﬁrst step, we compare three independent 1D radiative-convective models: {ATMO}, Exo-{REM}, and {petitCODE}. We identify differences in physical and chemical processes that are taken into account thanks to a benchmark protocol we have developed. We study the impact of these differences on the analysis of observable spectra. We show the importance of selecting carefully relevant molecular linelists to compute the atmospheric opacity. Indeed, differences between spectra calculated with Hitran and {ExoMol} exceed the expected uncertainties of future {JWST} observations. We also show the limits of the precision of the models due to uncertainties on alkali and molecule lineshape, which induce spectral effects that are also larger than the expected {JWST} uncertainties. We compare two chemical models, Exo-{REM} and Venot Chemical Code, which do not lead to signiﬁcant differences in the emission or transmission spectra. We discuss the observational consequences of using equilibrium or out-of-equilibrium chemistry and the major impact of phosphine, detectable with the {JWST}. Each of the models has beneﬁted from the benchmarking activity and has been updated. The protocol developed in this paper and the online results can constitute a test case for other models.},

	abstract = {We report high-precision, high-cadence photometric measurements of the star {HD} 209458, which is known from radial velocity measurements to have a planetary-mass companion in a close orbit. We detect two separate transit events at times that are consistent with the radial velocity measurements. In both cases, the detailed shape of the transit curve due to both the limb darkening of the star and the ﬁnite size of the planet is clearly evident. Assuming stellar parameters of 1.1 R, and 1.1 M,, we ﬁnd that the data are best interpreted as a gas giant with a radius of 1.27 ע 0.02 {RJup} in an orbit with an inclination of 87Њ.1 ע 0Њ.2. We present values for the planetary surface gravity, escape velocity, and average density and discuss the numerous observations that are warranted now that a planet is known to transit the disk of its parent star.},
