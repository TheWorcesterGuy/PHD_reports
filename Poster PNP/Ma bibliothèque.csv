Atmosphere models are generated with our state-of-the-art 1D radiative-convective equilibrium code ATMO, and are used as surface boundary conditions to calculate the interior structure and evolution of 0.001–0.075 M objects. Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H–He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by ∼1−2% at the stellar–substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO, which now contains signiﬁcantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present signiﬁcant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressuretemperature structure of the atmosphere. We show the impact of vertical mixing on emission spectra and in colour-magnitude diagrams, highlighting how the 3.5−5.5 µm ﬂux window can be used to calibrate vertical mixing in cool T–Y spectral type objects.","2020-05","2021-10-21 16:11:54","2021-10-25 08:07:09","2021-10-21 16:11:54","A38","","","637","","A&A","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/cwilkinson/Zotero/storage/66DJQ6BX/Phillips et al. - 2020 - A new set of atmosphere and evolution models for c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Planet density estimates are then compared to these mass-radius relationships, even when these planets are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.1 times the insolation at Earth for planets orbiting a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and would instead form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use a 1-D radiative-convective inverse version of the LMD generic numerical climate model to derive new theoretical mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich rocky planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit, meaning planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere. As a result of the runaway greenhouse radius inﬂation effect introduced in previous work, these new mass-radius relationships signiﬁcantly differ from those traditionally used in the literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation limit tends to dramatically overestimate -possibly by several orders of magnitude- their bulk water content. In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d, which can accommodate a water mass fraction of at most 2, 0.3 and 0.08%, respectively, assuming planetary core with a terrestrial composition. In addition, we show that signiﬁcant changes of mass-radius relationships (between planets less and more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse limit) can be used to remove bulk composition degeneracies in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1. Broadly speaking, our results demonstrate that nonH2/He-dominated atmospheres can have a ﬁrst-order effect on the mass-radius relationships, even for rocky planets receiving moderate irradiation. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere thickness as a function of planet core gravity and radius, water content, and irradiation. This formula can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for any water-rich, rocky planet (i.e., with any kind of interior composition ranging from pure iron to pure silicate) more irradiated than the runaway greenhouse irradiation threshold.","2020-06","2021-10-26 14:27:46","2021-10-26 14:27:46","2021-10-26 14:27:46","A41","","","638","","A&A","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/cwilkinson/Zotero/storage/3K4RQYGW/Turbet et al. - 2020 - Revised mass-radius relationships for water-rich r.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For Earth, this extreme climate transition is thought to occur for an increase of only ∼6% in solar luminosity, though the exact limit at which the transition would occur is still a highly debated topic. In general, the runaway greenhouse is believed to be a fundamental process in the evolution of Earth-sized, temperate planets. Using 1D radiative-convective climate calculations accounting for thick, hot water vapor-dominated atmospheres, we evaluate the transit atmospheric thickness of a post-runaway greenhouse atmosphere, and ﬁnd that it could possibly reach over a thousand kilometers (i.e., a few tens of percent of the Earth’s radius). This abrupt radius inﬂation resulting from the runaway-greenhouse-induced transition could be detected statistically by ongoing and upcoming space missions. These include satellites such as TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO combined with precise radial velocity mass measurements using ground-based spectrographs such as ESPRESSO, CARMENES, or SPIRou. This radius inﬂation could also be detected in multiplanetary systems such as TRAPPIST-1 once masses and radii are known with good enough precision. This result provides the community with an observational test of two points. The ﬁrst point is the concept of runaway greenhouse, which deﬁnes the inner edge of the traditional habitable zone, and the exact limit of the runaway greenhouse transition. In particular, this could provide an empirical measurement of the irradiation at which Earth analogs transition from a temperate to a runaway greenhouse climate state. This astronomical measurement would make it possible to statistically estimate how close Earth is from the runaway greenhouse. Second, it could be used as a test for the presence (and statistical abundance) of water in temperate, Earth-sized exoplanets.","2019-08","2021-10-26 14:36:28","2021-10-26 14:36:29","2021-10-26 14:36:28","A12","","","628","","A&A","The runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/cwilkinson/Zotero/storage/LRU53CVJ/Turbet et al. - 2019 - The runaway greenhouse radius inflation effect An.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These low-mass planets are highly irradiated and the question of their origin, evolution, and possible links remains open.

Masses ranging from 0.01 Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02–10 AU are considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the ﬁrst to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range of orbital separations (0.02–10 AU ) through a nongray radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 AU contracts as slowly as a planet at 0.1 AU. We conﬁrm the assertion of Guillot that very old giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once the planet’s intrinsic ﬂux drops to a small fraction of the incident ﬂux. For hydrogenhelium planets, we consider cores up to 90% of the total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ‘‘hot Neptunes’’ have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of more massive planets, radii of $0.30–0.45 RJ are expected. Water planets are $40%–50% larger than rocky planets, independent of mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we ﬁt our results to analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates, given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii. These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space missions, including COROT and Kepler.","2007-04-20","2021-11-02 10:54:56","2021-11-02 10:54:56","2021-11-02 10:54:56","1661-1672","","2","659","","ApJ","Planetary Radii across Five Orders of Magnitude in Mass and Stellar Insolation","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/cwilkinson/Zotero/storage/EVRGFVKV/Fortney et al. - 2007 - Planetary Radii across Five Orders of Magnitude in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Up to date there is no consensus about the composition of its envelope although most studies suggest a high molecular weight atmosphere. In particular, it is unclear if hydrogen and helium are present or if the atmosphere is water dominated. Here, we present results on the composition of the envelope obtained by using an internal structure and evolutionary model to ﬁt the mass and radius data. By examining all possible mixtures of water and H/He, with the corresponding opacities, we ﬁnd that the bulk amount of H/He of GJ 1214b is at most 7% by mass. In general, we ﬁnd the radius of warm sub-Neptunes to be most sensitive to the amount of H/He. We note that all (Kepler-11b,c,d,f, Kepler-18b, Kepler-20b, 55Cnc-e, Kepler-36c, and Kepler-68b) but two (Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b) of the discovered low-mass planets so far have less than 10% H/He. In fact, Kepler-11e and Kepler-30b have 10%–18% and 5%–15% bulk H/He. Conversely, little can be determined about the H2O or rocky content of sub-Neptune planets. We ﬁnd that although a 100% water composition ﬁts the data for GJ 1214b, based on formation constraints the presence of heavier refractory material on this planet is expected, and hence, so is a component lighter than water required. The same is true for Kepler-11f.

Using the Eddington approximation, we derive an analytical model to account for lines and/or bands in the infrared. Four parameters (instead of two for the semi-grey models) are used: a visible opacity (κv), two infrared opacities, (κ1 and κ2), and β (the fraction of the energy in the beam with opacities κ1). We consider that the atmosphere receives an incident irradiation in the visible with an eﬀective temperature Tirr and at an angle µ∗, and that it is heated from below with an eﬀective temperature Tint. Results. Our non-grey, irradiated line model is found to provide a range of temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical calculations. We ﬁnd that if the stellar ﬂux is absorbed at optical depth larger than τlim = (κR/κ1κ2)(κRκP/3)1/2, it is mainly transported by the channel of lowest opacity whereas if it is absorbed at τ >∼ τlim it is mainly transported by the channel of highest opacity, independently of the spectral width of those channels. For low values of β (expected when lines are dominant), we ﬁnd that the non-grey eﬀects signiﬁcantly cool the upper atmosphere. However, for β >∼ 1/2 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence smaller than or comparable to the width of the Planck function), we ﬁnd that the temperature structure is aﬀected down to infrared optical depths unity and deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing eﬀect. Conclusions. The expressions that we derive can be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that invert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full atmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be useful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal evolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative transfer models and to improve their convergence.","2014-02","2021-11-18 17:33:16","2021-11-18 17:33:16","2021-11-18 17:33:16","A133","","","562","","A&A","A non-grey analytical model for irradiated atmospheres","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/cwilkinson/Zotero/storage/AN2CD4JB/Parmentier et Guillot - 2014 - A non-grey analytical model for irradiated atmosph.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cloud scheme with simple microphysics appears to be the best parametrization by successfully reproducing the observed photometry and spectra of brown dwarfs and young giant exoplanets. In particular, it reproduces the L–T transition, due to the condensation of silicate and iron clouds below the visible/near-IR photosphere. It also reproduces the reddening observed for low-gravity objects, due to an increase of cloud optical depth for low gravity. In addition, we found that the cloud greenhouse effect shifts chemical equilibrium, increasing the abundances of species stable at high temperature. This effect should signiﬁcantly contribute to the strong variation of methane abundance at the L–T transition and to the methane depletion observed on young exoplanets. Finally, we predict the existence of a continuum of brown dwarfs and exoplanets for absolute J magnitude=15–18 and J - K color=0–3, due to the evolution of the L–T transition with gravity.

To explore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets we have employed model planets created by one implementation of the core accretion mechanism as initial conditions for evolutionary calculations. We find that young jovian planets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than predicted by earlier models. Furthermore the time interval during which the young jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter mass planets (1 M_J) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little at 20 million years, but 10 M_J planets can take up to 1 billion years to match commonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core accretion mechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the accretion shock, are correct, then young jovian planets are substantially fainter at young ages than currently believed.

While equations of state based on first principles or ab initio simulations have been available and used for the two most abundant elements constituting the envelope, hydrogen and helium, significant discrepancies remain regarding the predictions of the inner structure of Jupiter. The differences are severe enough to clutter the analysis of Juno's data and even cast doubts on the usefulness of these computationally expensive EOSs for the modeling of the interior of Jupiter and exoplanets at large. Using our newly developed equations of state for hydrogen and helium, we asses the ab initio equations of state currently available and establish their efficiency at predicting the interior structure of Jupiter in a two-layers model. By adjusting our free energy parameterization to reproduce previous ab initio EOS behavior, we identify the source of the disagreement previously reported for the interior structure of Jupiter. We further point to area where care should be taken when building EOS for the modeling of giant planets. This concerns the interpolation between the ab initio results and the physical models used to cover the low density range as well as the interpolation of the {\sl ab initio} simulation results at high densities. This sensitivity falls well within the uncertainties of the ab initio simulations. This suggests that hydrogen EOS should be carefully benchmarked using a simple planetary model before being used in the more advanced planetary models needed to interpret the Juno data.

Our models include several key improvements to the input physics used in previous models available in the literature. Most notably, the use of a new H-He equation of state including ab initio quantum molecular dynamics calculations has raised the mass by $\sim1-2\%$ at the stellar-substellar boundary and has altered the cooling tracks around the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses. A second key improvement concerns updated molecular opacities in our atmosphere model ATMO, which now contains significantly more line transitions required to accurately capture the opacity in these hot atmospheres. This leads to warmer atmospheric temperature structures, further changing the cooling curves and predicted emission spectra of substellar objects. We present significant improvement for the treatment of the collisionally broadened potassium resonance doublet, and highlight the importance of these lines in shaping the red-optical and near-infrared spectrum of brown dwarfs. We generate three different grids of model simulations, one using equilibrium chemistry and two using non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, all three computed self-consistently with the pressure-temperature structure of the atmosphere.

The composition implies a mass-radius relation which relies heavily on equations of state calculated from electronic structure theory and measured experimentally on Earth. We lay out a method for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and mass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably well established, and for differentiated Fe/rock. We find that variations in the equation of state, such as may arise when extrapolating from low pressure data, can have significant effects on predicted mass- radius relations, and on planetary pressure profiles. The relations are compared with the observed masses and radii of planets and exoplanets. Kepler-10b is apparently 'Earth- like,' likely with a proportionately larger core than Earth's, nominally 2/3 of the mass of the planet. CoRoT-7b is consistent with a rocky mantle over an Fe-based core which is likely to be proportionately smaller than Earth's. GJ 1214b lies between the mass-radius curves for H2O and CH4, suggesting an 'icy' composition with a relatively large core or a relatively large proportion of H2O. CoRoT-2b is less dense than the hydrogen relation, which could be explained by an anomalously high degree of heating or by higher than assumed atmospheric opacity. HAT-P-2b is slightly denser than the mass-radius relation for hydrogen, suggesting the presence of a significant amount of matter of higher atomic number. CoRoT-3b lies close to the hydrogen relation. The pressure at the center of Kepler-10b is 1.5+1.2-1.0 TPa.

While only the masses of the planets orbiting the brightest stars can be determined by ground-based spectroscopic observations, these observations allow calculation of their average densities placing constraints on the bulk compositions and internal structures. However, an important question about the composition of planets ranging from 2 to 4 Earth radii (R               ⊕               ) still remains. They may either have a rocky core enveloped in a H               2               –He gaseous envelope (gas dwarfs) or contain a significant amount of multicomponent, H               2               O-dominated ices/fluids (water worlds).

We review some of the key questions regarding their evolution with particular emphasis on giant gaseous exoplanets orbiting close to solar-type stars. For masses above that of Saturn, transiting exoplanets have large radii indicative of the presence of a massive hydrogen-helium envelope. Theoretical models show that this envelope progressively cools and contracts with a rate of energy loss inversely proportional to the planetary age. The combined measurement of planetary mass, radius and a constraint on the (stellar) age enables a global determination of the amount of heavy elements present in the planet interior. The comparison with stellar metallicity shows a correlation between the two, indicating that accretion played a crucial role in the formation of planets. The dynamical evolution of exoplanets also depends on the properties of the central star. We show that the lack of massive giant planets and brown dwarfs in close orbit around G-dwarfs and their presence around F-dwarfs are probably tied to the different properties of dissipation in the stellar interiors.

In addition, the transport of a floating body at the interface can be induced by secondary flows triggered by the amplitude gradients of the liquid vibrations.","2022-03","2022-05-30 09:49:14","2022-05-30 09:49:14","2022-05-30 09:49:14","328","","3","137","","Eur.
